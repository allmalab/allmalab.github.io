- name: Semantic embedding models for Azerbaijani
  description: Building a foundation model does not necessarily give us a semantic embedding model. We may need to fine-tune these models further for this task. This has been quite tricky for Azerbaijani.

- name: Web-scale text corpus for Azerbaijani
  description: There are several Azerbaijani text corpora at the scale of hundreds of millions of words. We intend to push this number to billions without sacrificing the quality. This requires sophisticated automation pipelines in several stages.

aLLMA Lab has no employees. You can contribute to our cause by...<br>

<ul>
<li> <b>...using our resources:</b> We try to release all of ours works publicly, including code, data, and models. The easiest way to help us using these resources in your work, giving us feedback, and of course citing us!
<li> <b>...opening issues and pull requests:</b> We host our work on <a target="_blank" href="https:github.com/allmalab">GitHub</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https:huggingface.com/allmalab">Hugging Face</a>. If you face any problems or have an idea, simply open an issue. If you have fixed the issue yourself, that is even better! Open a pull request and we will try to integrate your work.
<li> <b>...joining the team:</b> We do not have a standard "hiring" process. If a person collaborated with us for some time, we can offer them to be a member.
<li> <b>...collaborating as an organization:</b> We do not work in isolation! So far, we have collaborated with PRODATA LLC, BHOS AI R&D center, and other organizations. If your organization is interested in promoting open-source NLP solutions for Azerbaijani, we would love to talk to you.

We are working to build foundation models for Azerbaijani. These models are encoder-only, which makes them suitable for various NLU tasks. First iteration of the project has been completed. We present our [results](https://aclanthology.org/2024.sigturk-1.2/) in ACL 2024, as part of the 1st SIGTURK Workshop. Our models are publicly hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/allmalab/allma-models-669b63077f28c43e091270cb). As a part of the project, we have also released [a text corpus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allmalab/DOLLMA), a [tokenizer](https://huggingface.co/allmalab/bert-tokenizer-aze) and several evaluation datasets for Azerbaini.
